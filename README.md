# UnsupervisedLearning-SeedsDataset
Dive into the world of unsupervised learning with our open-source repository! This project focuses on analyzing the SeedsDataset using various unsupervised learning techniques. Explore clustering algorithms to group similar seeds, discover underlying patterns, and gain valuable insights into the dataset.

This project mainly has 2 algorithms implemented which are principle component analysis and K-means clustering. The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for the experiment. High-quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combined harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin.
